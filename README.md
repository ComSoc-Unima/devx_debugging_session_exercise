# DevX Debugging Session: Exercise Collection

Welcome to the DevX Debugging Session exercises! This repository contains a series of graded exercises designed to help you sharpen your debugging skills in both **Java** and **JavaScript**.

## Overview

The exercises are structured as "broken" code snippets. Your goal is to identify and fix the errors — whether they are syntax errors that prevent compilation/execution or logical errors that produce incorrect results.

### Difficulty Levels
The directories are organized by increasing difficulty:

1.  **[exercise_1](./exercise_1)**: **Beginner**
    *   Focus: Basic syntax errors (missing semicolons, parentheses) and simple logical bugs.
    *   Structure: Single functions or short classes.
2.  **[exercise_2](./exercise_2)**: **Intermediate**
    *   Focus: More complex logic, multi-step calculations, and common pitfalls in conditional statements.
    *   Structure: Multiple interacting functions and helper methods.
3.  **[exercise_3](./exercise_3)**: **Advanced**
    *   Focus: Complex call chains, nested logic, and scenarios requiring professional debugging tools (like breakpoints and variable watches).
    *   Structure: Robust scenarios with multiple bugs hidden across the codebase.

## Folder Structure & Naming

The exercises are implemented in Java and JavaScript. To maintain clarity, the following naming convention is used across all directories:

*   **Java**: Named using word-based numbering (e.g., `ExerciseOneOne.java`, `ExerciseThreeTwo.java`).
*   **JavaScript**: Named using underscored numbering (e.g., `Exercise_1_1.js`).

Parity exists between Java and JavaScript versions for the **Beginner** and **Intermediate** levels.

## How to Use

1.  **Select an Exercise**: Choose a directory and a language.
2.  **Read the Scenario**: Every file starts with a comment block describing the scenario and expected output.
3.  **Run the Code**:
    *   **JavaScript**: `node Exercise_X_X.js`
    *   **Java**: `java ExerciseWordNumber.java`
4.  **Debug**: Use `console.log`, `System.out.println`, or your IDE's debugger to find the bug.
5.  **Verify**: Ensure the output matches the **EXPECTED OUTPUT** described in the source file comments.
